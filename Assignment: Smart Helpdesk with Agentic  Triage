Goal: Build an end‑to‑end web application where users raise support tickets and an AI 
coworker (agentic workflow) triages them by classifying, fetching relevant knowledge‑base (KB) 
articles, drafting a reply, and either auto‑resolving or assigning to a human. You may do this as 
MERN‑only (Node orchestrator) or MERN + Python (FastAPI worker). You are free to use your 
favourite vibe coding techniques.
